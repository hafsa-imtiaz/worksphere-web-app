# How to Run WorkSphere

## 1. Clone the Repository

To download the project, use the following command:
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/hafsa-imtiaz/worksphere.git
 cd worksphere
```

## 2. Required Software and Setup
Before running WorkSphere, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17+** ([Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html))
- **Spring Boot** (Managed via `pom.xml`)
- **MySQL Server** (To store project and task data)
- **VS Code Extensions** (Optional, but recommended)
  - Live Server (for frontend development)
  - Spring Boot Extension Pack (for backend development)
  - Java Extension Pack (for Java support)
  - Lombok Annotations Support for VS Code

## 3. Database Setup (MySQL)
1. Start **MySQL Server**.
2. Open **MySQL Workbench** or a terminal.
3. Create the database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE worksphere_db;
   ```
4. Import the provided SQL file to set up tables.

---

## 4. Configure Backend (Spring Boot)
The backend is located in `com.example.worksphere` and consists of:
- `config` – Security and database settings.
- `dto` – Data transfer objects.
- `entity` – Database models.
- `repository` – Database interaction.
- `service` – Business logic.

### Update `application.properties` for MySQL:
```properties
spring.application.name=worksphere_db
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/worksphere_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=your_password
```
Replace `your_password` with your MySQL password.

### Run the Backend:
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```
If Maven is not installed, use:
```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.


### Run the Frontend:
```sh
cd frontend
```
Now run this command:
```sh
npm start
```
The frontenfd should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

---

## 5. Run the Frontend
The frontend is located in `src/main/resources/static`.

### Steps:
1. Open the **VS Code** project.
2. Navigate to the `static` folder.
3. Open `landing.html`.
4. Right-click and select **Open with Live Server** or visit `http://localhost:8080/landing.html`.

---

## 6. Common Issues and Fixes

### **Backend Not Starting**
- Ensure MySQL is running.
- Verify `application.properties` contains the correct database credentials.

### **Login Not Working**
- Check the browser console (`F12 > Console`).
- Ensure the backend is running.

### **Signup Not Storing Data**
- Verify the MySQL database contains the necessary tables.
